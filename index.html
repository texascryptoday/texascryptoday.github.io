<h3>HOLMES: Efficient Distribution Testing for Secure Collaborative Learning<span class = "iconbox"><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>

<p>Using secure multiparty computation (MPC), organizations which own sensitive
data (e.g., in healthcare, finance or law enforcement) can train machine
learning models over their joint dataset without revealing their data to each
other. At the same time, secure computation restricts operations on the joint
dataset, which impedes computation to assess its quality. Without such an
assessment, deploying a jointly trained model is potentially illegal.
Regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), require organizations to be legally responsible for the errors, bias,
or discrimination caused by their machine learning models. Hence, testing data
quality emerges as an indispensable step in secure collaborative learning.
However, performing distribution testing is prohibitively expensive using
current techniques, as shown in our experiments.
</p>
<p>We present HOLMES, a protocol for performing distribution testing efficiently.
In our experiments, compared with three non-trivial baselines, HOLMES achieves
a speedup of more than 10× for classical distribution tests and up to 104× for
multidimensional tests. The core of HOLMES is a hybrid protocol that
integrates MPC with zero-knowledge proofs and a new ZK-friendly and naturally
oblivious sketching algorithm for multidimensional tests, both with
significantly lower computational complexity and concrete execution costs.

<h3>Applications of Machine Learning in Hardware Security<span class = "iconbox"><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>

<p>Over the last twenty years, hardware security and trust has evolved into a
major new area of research at the intersection of semiconductor manufacturing,
VLSI design and test, computer-aided design, architecture and system
security. During the same period, machine learning has experienced a major
revival in interest and has flourished from a nearly forgotten area to the
talk of the town. In this presentation, we will first briefly review various
machine learning-based solutions which have been developed to address a number
of concerns in hardware security and trust, including hardware Trojan
detection, counterfeit IC identification, provenance attestation,
hardware-based malware detection, side-channel attacks, PUF modeling,
etc. Then, we will examine the key attributes of these problems which make
them amenable to machine learning-based solutions and we will discuss the
potential and the fundamental limitations of such approaches. Lastly, we will
ponder the role of and necessity for advanced contemporary machine learning
methods in the context of hardware security and we will conclude with
suggestions for avoiding common pitfalls when employing such methods.

<h3>Using Untrusted and Unreliable Cloud Providers to Obtain Private Email<span class = "iconbox"><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tgutk1MQs6Yi1S5O2NKpI2IJYuG8cLm1/view?usp=share_link" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><img class = "pubicon" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></a></span></h3>

<p>A recent trend for organizations is to shift to cloud services which typically
include email. As a result, the natural privacy concerns for users stem not
only from outside attackers, but from insiders as well. Our solution does not
rely on unproven assumptions and does not need a PKI. To achieve this, we
partially rely on concepts from Private and Secure Message Transmission
protocols, which are built on top of secret sharing. This technology allows us
to distribute trust over email providers. Hence, the system remains secure as
long as hackers are unable to penetrate a threshold number of providers, or
this set of providers does not form a coalition to attack their users. The
prototype of our proposed system has been implemented as an add-on for the
Thunderbird email client, using Mozilla’s Web Crypto API and Rempe’s secret.js
library. It currently supports the following secret sharing schemes: the
2-out-2 additive scheme (set as a default), the k-out-n threshold Shamir
scheme, and the Rabin and Ben-Or robust scheme.

<h3>Time-Lock Puzzles with Efficient Batch Solving<span class = "iconbox"><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>
<p>Rachit Garg (UT Austin) <br />
</p>
<p>Time-Lock Puzzles (TLPs) are a powerful tool for concealing messages until a
predetermined point in time. When solving multiple puzzles, it becomes crucial
to have the ability to batch-solve puzzles, i.e., simultaneously open multiple
puzzles while working to solve a single one. Unfortunately, all previously
known TLP constructions that support batch solving rely on super-polynomially
secure indistinguishability obfuscation, making them impractical.
</p>
<p>In light of this challenge, we present novel TLP constructions that offer
batch-solving capabilities without using heavy cryptographic hammers. Our
proposed schemes are simple and concretely efficient, and they can be
constructed based on well-established cryptographic assumptions based on
pairings or learning with errors (LWE). Along the way, we introduce new
constructions of puncturable key- homomorphic PRFs both in the lattice and in
the pairing setting, which may be of independent interest.  Our analysis
leverages an interesting connection to Hall’s marriage theorem and
incorporates an optimized combinatorial approach, enhancing the practicality
and feasibility of our TLP schemes.  Furthermore, we introduce the concept of
&ldquo;rogue-puzzle attacks&rdquo;, where maliciously crafted puzzle instances may disrupt
the batch-solving process of honest puzzles. We then propose constructions of
concrete and efficient TLPs designed to prevent such attacks.
