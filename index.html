<h3>Adaptive Security, Erasures, and Network Assumptions in Communication-Local MPC<span class = "iconbox"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1489.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><img class = "pubicon" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/></a><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>

</p>
<p>The problem of reliable/secure all-to-all communication over low-degree
networks has been essential for communication-local (CL) \(n\)-party secure
multi-party computation (MPC) (i.e., MPC protocols where every party directly
communicates only with a few parties, typically poly-logarithmic in \(n\)) and
more recently for communication over ad hoc networks, which are used in
blockchain protocols. However, a limited number of adaptively secure solutions
exist, and they all make relatively strong assumptions on the ability of
parties to act in some specific manner before the adversary can corrupt them.
Two such assumptions were made in the work of Chandran et al. <a href="ITCS’15" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>ITCS’15</a>—
parties can (a) multi-send messages to several receivers simultaneously;
and (b) securely erase the message and the identities of the receivers, before
the adversary gets a chance to corrupt the sender (even if a receiver is
corrupted).
</p>
<p>A natural question to ask is: Are these assumptions necessary for adaptively
secure CL-MPC? In this work we characterize the feasibility landscape for
all-to-all reliable message transmission (RMT) under these two assumptions,
and use this characterization to obtain (asymptotically) tight feasibility
results for CL-MPC.

<h3>Complexity Theory for Quantum Promise Problems and Its Applications to Cryptography<span class = "iconbox"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03716" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><img class = "pubicon" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/></a><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>

<p>Quantum computing introduces many well-motivated problems rooted in physics,
asking to com- pute information from input quantum states. Identifying the
computational hardness of these prob- lems yields potential applications with
far-reaching impacts across both the realms of computer science and physics.
However, these new problems do not neatly fit within the scope of exist- ing
complexity theory. The standard classes primarily cater to problems with
classical inputs and outputs, leaving a gap to characterize problems involving
quantum states as inputs. Notably, the emergence of new quantum cryptographic
primitives is reshaping our understanding of the minimal assumption in
cryptography, which directly affects the relationships between cryptography
and com- plexity theory; in particular, the connection between Minicrypt and
Pessiland in Impagliazzo’s five worlds view is somewhat unclear — one reason
for this is that breaking new quantum cryptographic primitives involves
solving problems with quantum inputs, while the complexity classes central to
Pessiland, Heuristica, and Algorithmica are grounded in problems with
classical inputs and outputs.
</p>
<p>In this talk, I will introduce the complexity theory for quantum promise
problems and potential applications. Quantum promise problems are
quantum-input decision problems asking to identify whether input quantum
states (that can be pure and mixed states) satisfy specific properties. We
will see structural results for complexity classes, p<i>mBQP, p</i>mQ(C)MA,
p<i>mQSZKhv, p</i>mQIP, and p<i>mPSPACE, where “p</i>mC” denotes the corresponding
quantum promise complexity class with pure (p) or mixed (m) quantum input
states for any classical complexity class C. Surprisingly, our results reveal
relationships that differ from their classical counterparts, such as p<i>mQIP ̸=
p</i>mPSPACE and mcoQSZKhv ̸= mQSZKhv. Building on this framework, we will see
applications to cryptography, demonstrating that breaking one-way state
generators and pseudorandom states, and EFI has mQCMA and mQSZKhv upper
bounds, and that the average-case hardness of pQCZKhv implies the existence of
EFI. Notably, our results offer new insights into Impagliazzo’s five worlds
view. Roughly, by substituting classical complexity classes in Pessiland,
Heuristica, and Algorithmica with mBQP and mQCMA or mQSZKhv, we establish a
natural connection between quantum cryptography and quantum promise complexity
theory.

<h3>Distributed Broadcast Encryption from Lattices<span class = "iconbox"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1417.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><img class = "pubicon" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/></a><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>

</p>
<p>A broadcast encryption scheme allows a user to encrypt a message to \(N\)
recipients with a ciphertext whose size scales sublinearly with \(N\). While
broadcast encryption enables succinct encrypted broadcasts, it also introduces
a strong trust assumption and a single point of failure; namely, there is a
central authority who generates the decryption keys for all users in the
system. Distributed broadcast encryption offers an appealing alternative where
there is a one-time (trusted) setup process that generates a set of public
parameters. Thereafter, users can independently generate their own public keys
and post them to a public-key directory. Moreover, anyone can broadcast an
encrypted message to any subset of user public keys with a ciphertext whose
size scales sublinearly with the size of the broadcast set. Unlike traditional
broadcast encryption, there are no long-term secrets in distributed broadcast
encryption and users can join the system at any time (by posting their public
key to the public-key directory).
</p>
<p>Previously, distributed broadcast encryption schemes were known from standard
pairing-based assumptions or from powerful tools like indistinguishability
obfuscation or witness encryption. In this talk, I will describe the first
distributed broadcast encryption scheme from a falsifiable lattice assumption.
Specifically, we rely on the \(\ell\)-succinct learning with errors (LWE) assumption
introduced by Wee (CRYPTO 2024). Previously, the only lattice-based candidate
for distributed broadcast encryption goes through general-purpose witness
encryption, which in turn is only known from the private-coin evasive LWE
assumption, a strong and non-falsifiable lattice assumption. Along the way, I
will also describe a direct construction of broadcast encryption from lattices
that does not rely on any homomorphic evaluation machinery.

<h3>A Composability Treatment of Bitcoin’s Transaction Ledger with Variable Difficulty<span class = "iconbox"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1823.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><img class = "pubicon" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/></a><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>
<p>Brady Testa (Texas A&amp;M) <br />
</p>
<p>As the first proof-of-work (PoW) permissionless blockchain, Bitcoin aims at
maintaining a decentralized yet consistent transaction ledger as protocol
participants (“miners”) join and leave as they please. This is achieved by
means of a subtle PoW difficulty adjustment mechanism that adapts to the
perceived block generation rate, and important steps have been taken in
previous work to provide a rigorous analysis of the conditions (such as bounds
on dynamic participation) that are sufficient for Bitcoin’s security
properties to be ascertained.
</p>
<p>Such existing analysis, however, is property-based, and as such only
guarantees security when the proto- col is run in isolation. In this paper we
present the first (to our knowledge) simulation-based analysis of the Bitcoin
ledger in the dynamic setting where it operates, and show that the protocol
abstraction known as the Bitcoin backbone protocol emulates, under certain
participation restrictions, Bitcoin’s intended specification. Our formulation
and analysis extend the existing Universally Composable treat- ment for the
fixed-difficulty setting, and develop techniques that might be of broader
applicability, in particular to other composable formulations of blockchain
protocols that rely on difficulty adjustment.

<h3>New Techniques for Preimage Sampling: Improved NIZKs and More from LWE<span class = "iconbox"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1401.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><img class = "pubicon" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/></a><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>
<p><a href="https://cs.utexas.edu/~dwu4/papers/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>David Wu</a> (UT Austin) <br />
</p>
<p>Recent constructions of vector commitments and non-interactive zero-knowledge
(NIZK) proofs from LWE implicitly solve a shifted multi-preimage sampling
problem. In this talk I will introduce the shifted multi-preimage sampling
problem and then show how recent lattice-based constructions of vector
commitments and hidden-bits model NIZKs can be viewed from the perspective of
designing a solution to the shifted multi-preimage sampling problem. I will
then describe a new technique for solving the shifted multi-preimage sampling
problem by deriving a structured matrix with a public trapdoor from a short
random string.
</p>
<p>These techniques immediately yields the following improvements to
lattice-based vector commitments and hidden-bits model NIZKs:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We provide a dual-mode instantiation of the hidden-bits model (and by
correspondence, a dual-mode NIZK proof for NP) with (1) a linear-size common
reference string (CRS); (2) a transparent setup in hiding mode (which yields
statistical NIZK arguments); and (3) hardness from LWE with a polynomial
modulus-to-noise ratio. This improves upon the work of Waters (STOC 2024)
which required a quadratic-size structured reference string (in both modes)
and LWE with a super-polynomial modulus-to-noise ratio.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>We give a statistically-hiding vector commitment with transparent setup and
polylogarithmic-size CRS, commitments, and openings from SIS. This
simultaneously improves upon the vector commitment schemes of de Castro and
Peikert (EUROCRYPT 2023) as well as Wee and Wu (EUROCRYPT 2023).
