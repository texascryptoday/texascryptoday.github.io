<h3>ABE for Circuits with poly(λ)-sized Keys from LWE<span class = "iconbox"><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>

</p>
<p>We present a key-policy attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme for
circuits based on the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption whose key
size is independent of the circuit depth. Our result constitutes the
first improvement for ABE for circuits from LWE in almost a decade,
given by Gorbunov, Vaikuntanathan, and Wee (STOC 2013) and Boneh, et
al. (EUROCRYPT 2014) &ndash; we reduce the key size in the latter from
poly(depth, λ) to poly(λ). The starting point of our construction is a
recent ABE scheme of Li, Lin, and Luo (TCC 2022), which achieves poly(λ) key size but
requires pairings and generic bilinear groups in addition to LWE; we introduce
new lattice techniques to eliminate the additional requirements.

<h3>Classical Verification of Quantum Depth<span class = "iconbox"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04656.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><img class = "pubicon" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/></a><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>

<p>Verifying if a remote server has sufficient quantum resources to demonstrate
quantum advantage is a fascinating question in complexity theory and a
practical challenge. One approach is asking the server to solve some
classically intractable problem, such as factoring. Another approach is the
proof of quantumness protocols. These protocols enable a classical client to
check whether a remote server can complete some classically intractable
problem and thus can be used to distinguish quantum from classical computers.
However, these two approaches mainly focus on distinguishing quantum computers
from classical ones. They do not directly translate into ones that separate
quantum computers with different quantum resources.
</p>
<p>In this talk, we want to go one step further by showing protocols that can
distinguish machines with different quantum depths. We call such protocols
Classical Verification of Quantum Depth (CVQD). Roughly speaking, if a server
has quantum circuit depth at most d, the classical client will reject it;
otherwise, the classical client will accept it. Note that a malicious server,
in general, can use classical computers to cheat. Thus, CVQD protocols shall
be able to distinguish hybrid quantum-classical computers with different
quantum depths. We will see two CVQD protocols: The first protocol can
separate hybrid quantum-classical computers with quantum depth d and d+c (for
c some fixed constant) assuming quantum LWE with d rounds. The second protocol
is a one-round protocol assuming quantum LWE and the classical random oracle
heuristics.

<h3>Strong Batching for Non-interactive Statistical Zero-Knowledge<span class = "iconbox"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/229.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><img class = "pubicon" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/></a><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>

</p>
<p>A zero-knowledge proof enables a prover to convince a verifier that a
statement is true, without revealing anything beyond this fact. By running a
zero-knowledge proof k times, it is possible to prove (still in
zero-knowledge) that k separate statements are all true. However, this
increases the communication by a multiplicative factor of k. Can one do
better? In other words, is (non-trivial) zero-knowledge batch verification
possible?
</p>
<p>Previous work of Kaslasi et al. (TCC 2020, Eurocrypt 2021) presented
non-trivial batching for problems that have a non-interactive statistical
zero-knowledge, but (1) at the cost of introducing interaction and (2)
achieved communication that is roughly poly(n)+k, which is non-trivial but
still scales linearly with k. In this talk, we show how to overcome both
obstacles and achieve non-interactive batching with total communication of
poly(n, log k).

<h3>Is It Even Possible? On the Parallel Composition of Asynchronous Cryptographic Protocols<span class = "iconbox"><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>

<p>Cryptographers often idealize the underlying network and model it as
synchronous by assuming round-based progress and message delivery to simplify
their design and analysis. However, modeling real-world networks with
synchronous communication often incurs significant overhead or introduces
unrealistic assumptions about message delivery guarantees. Therefore, the
value of studying synchronous networks critically hinges on the
ability to translate those results to the more challenging asynchronous
setting.
</p>
<p>In this talk, we show that running individual protocols in parallel to realize
the parallel composition of their desired functionalities, which seamlessly
works in the synchronous setting, does not extend to asynchronous
environments. Further, we rule out the possibility of any black-box compiler
for the parallel composition of general protocol classes in such settings.
Yet, not everything is lost: We also offer hope by introducing a protocol
class along with a compiler designed to achieve parallel composition in
asynchronous networks. Remarkably, our protocol class can accommodate all
existing asynchronous MPC (A-MPC) protocols with only minor adjustments.
Furthermore, despite the probabilistic termination inherent in all A-MPC
protocols, which naturally leads to a round blow-up under concurrent
composition, our compiler effectively preserves the round complexity of
protocols in that class.

<h3>Batch Arguments to NIZKs from One-Way Functions<span class = "iconbox"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1938.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><img class = "pubicon" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/></a><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>
<p>Eli Bradley (UT Austin) <br />
</p>
<p>Succinctness and zero-knowledge are two fundamental properties in the study of
cryptographic proof systems. Several recent works have formalized the
connections between these two notions by showing how to realize
non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) arguments from succinct non-interactive
arguments. Specifically, Champion and Wu (CRYPTO 2023) as well as Bitansky,
Kamath, Paneth, Rothblum, and Vasudevan (STOC 2024) recently showed how to
construct a NIZK argument for NP from a (somewhere-sound) non-interactive
batch argument (BARG) and a dual-mode commitment scheme (and in the case of
the Champion-Wu construction, a local pseudorandom generator). The main open
question is whether a BARG suffices for a NIZK (just assuming one-way
functions).
</p>
<p>In this talk, I will show that an adaptively-sound BARG for NP together with
an one-way function imply a computational NIZK argument for NP. Using complexity
leveraging, adaptively-sound BARGs can be based on a sub-exponentially-secure
somewhere sound BARG. Taken together, we obtain a NIZK argument for NP from one-way
functions and a sub-exponentially-secure somewhere-sound BARG for NP. I then
show that if we instead start with public-key encryption instead of one-way functions,
then a polynomially-secure somewhere-sound batch argument for NP suffices for the
same implication. As a corollary, this means a somewhere-sound BARG can be
used to generically upgrade any semantically-secure public-key encryption
scheme into one secure against chosen-ciphertext attacks. More broadly, our
results demonstrate that constructing non-interactive batch arguments for NP
is essentially no easier than constructing NIZK arguments for NP.
