<h3>Doubly Efficient Private Information Retrieval and Fully Homomorphic RAM Computation from Ring LWE<span class = "iconbox"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1703" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><img class = "pubicon" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/></a><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>

<p>Can we design a private variant of &ldquo;Google search&rdquo; that would enable users to search the Internet privately without revealing their queries to Google? Fully homomorphic encryption gives a potential solution to this problem, but would require Google to run a huge computation that is linear in the size of the entire internet to answer each encrypted search query, making it realistically infeasible! Is there a way for Google to preprocess the internet content into a special data structure that would then allow it to answer each encrypted search query very efficiently by only accessing a small number of locations in the data structure? We give a solution to this problem as a special case of our work.
</p>
<p>Concretely, we construct the first schemes for &ldquo;doubly efficient private information retrieval (DEPIR)&rdquo; and &ldquo;fully homomorphic encryption in the RAM model (RAM-FHE)&rdquo; under standard cryptographic hardness assumptions (Ring Learning with Errors). Previously we only had heuristic candidate constructions that only satisfied relaxed variants of these primitives. Our new solutions combine tools from cryptography together with data structures for fast polynomial evaluation (Kedlaya and Umans &rsquo;08).

<h3>Hertzbleed: Turning Power Side-Channel Attacks Into Remote Timing Attacks on x86<span class = "iconbox"><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>

</p>
<p>Hertzbleed is a new family of side-channel attacks: frequency side channels. In the worst case, these attacks can allow an attacker to extract cryptographic keys from remote servers that were previously believed to be secure.
</p>
<p>Hertzbleed takes advantage of our experiments showing that, under certain circumstances, the dynamic frequency scaling of modern x86 processors depends on the data being processed. This means that, on modern processors, the same program can run at a different CPU frequency (and therefore take a different wall time) when computing, for example, 2022 + 23823 compared to 2022 + 24436.
</p>
<p>Hertzbleed is a real, and practical, threat to the security of cryptographic software. We have demonstrated how a clever attacker can use a novel chosen-ciphertext attack against SIKE (Now retired) to perform full key extraction via remote timing, despite SIKE being implemented as &ldquo;constant time.&rdquo;

<h3>Permissionless Clock Synchronization with Public Setup<span class = "iconbox"><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>

</p>
<p>The permissionless clock synchronization problem asks how it is possible for a population of parties to maintain a system-wide synchronized clock, while their participation rate fluctuatesâ€”possibly very widelyâ€”over time. The underlying assumption is that parties experience the passage of time with roughly the same speed, but however they may disengage and engage with the protocol following arbitrary (and even chosen adversarially) participation patterns. This (classical) problem has received renewed attention due to the advent of blockchain protocols, and recently it has been solved in the setting of proof of stake, i.e., when parties are assumed to have access to a trusted PKI setup [Badertscher et al., Eurocrypt &rsquo;21]. In this work, we present the first proof-of-work (PoW)-based permissionless clock synchronization protocol.
</p>
<p>Our construction assumes a public setup (e.g., a CRS) and relies on an honest majority of computational power that, for the first time, is described in a fine-grain timing model that does not utilize a global clock that exports the current time to all parties. As a secondary result of independent interest, our protocol gives rise to the first PoW-based ledger consensus protocol that does not rely on an external clock for the time-stamping of transactions and adjustment of the PoW difficulty.

<h3>Zero-knowledge proofs based on linear codes<span class = "iconbox"><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>
<p><a href="https://zhiyong1997.github.io/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Zhiyong Fang</a> (Texas A&amp;M) <br />
</p>
<p>Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) allows one party, referred to as the prover, to convince another party, referred to as the verifier, that a statement about the proverâ€™s secret witness is true. Zero-knowledge proof has been widely used in blockchains and crypto-currencies to achieve privacy and improve scalability. However, existing schemes with succinct proof size suffer from a high overhead on the proof generation time, limiting their efficiency and scalability in practice.
</p>
<p>In this talk, we will present our recent work on building succinct ZKPs based on linear error-correcting code. The security relies on the good distance of the code and the collision resistant hash functions. The prover time is dominated by the encoding time of the linear code. The scheme is plausibly post-quantum secure and has a transparent setup.
