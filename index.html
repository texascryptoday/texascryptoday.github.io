<h3>Foundations of Decentralized Mechanism Design<span class = "iconbox"><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>

</p>
<p>In classical auction design, we take it for granted that the auctioneer is
trusted and always implements the auction's rules honestly. This assumption,
however, no longer holds in modern auctions based on blockchains, or those
mediated by third-party platforms such as Google. For example, in
blockchain-based auctions, the consensus nodes that partly serve as the
auctioneer are incentivized to deviate from honest behavior if profitable.
Third-party auction platforms such as Google have also been involved in
high-profile anti-trust lawsuits for manipulating their auctions.
</p>
<p>In this talk, I will describe our recent work on decentralized mechanism
design, where we aim to build a new scientific foundation for emerging
auctions that are not backed by a trusted auctioneer. I will characterize the
mathematical landscape of decentralized mechanism design, by showing several
infeasibility and feasibility results. I will also highlight how cryptography
can play an essential role for bypassing impossibility results in
decentralized mechanism design, leading to a new class of auctions that not
only incentivize bidders to act honestly, but also incentivize the auctioneer
to play by the book.

<h3>Unconditionally Secure Auxiliary-Input Quantum Commitment with Statistical Hiding<span class = "iconbox"><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>

</p>
<p>We present the first unconditionally secure auxiliary-input quantum commitment
scheme with statistical hiding. Our construction resolves an open question
posed in [Qia24, MNY24] by proving security even when adversaries are equipped
with additional classical advice; however, the scheme fails in the presence of
quantum advice. Remarkably, this limitation not only poses a compelling open
problem in cryptography but also yields an unconditional separation in quantum
complexity theory. Specifically, our findings distinguish the quantum promise
complexity classes \(\mathsf{p}/\mathsf{mBQP}/\mathsf{qpoly}\) and \(\mathsf{p}/\mathsf{mBQP}/\mathsf{poly}\)â€”quantum analogues of the
classical \(\mathsf{BQP}/\mathsf{(q)poly}\) classes.

<h3>Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption from Linear Homomorphism and Sparse LPN<span class = "iconbox"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1760.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><img class = "pubicon" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/></a><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>
<p><a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/ahenz/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Alexandra Henzinger</a> (MIT) <br />
</p>
<p>In this talk, I will show how to construct somewhat homomorphic encryption
from the sparse learning-parities-with-noise problem, along with an assumption
that implies linearly homomorphic encryption (e.g., the decisional
Diffie-Hellman or decisional composite residuosity assumptions). The resulting
schemes support an a-priori bounded number of homomorphic operations: \(o(\log
\lambda)\) multiplications followed by \(\mathsf{poly}(\lambda)\) additions,
where \(\lambda\) is a security parameter. This gives the first constructions of
somewhat homomorphic encryption for the class of bounded-degree polynomials
that do not rely on lattice assumptions or bilinear maps. Moreover, our
schemes are conceptually simple: much as in Gentry, Sahai, and Watersâ€™ fully
homomorphic encryption scheme, ciphertexts in our scheme are matrices,
homomorphic addition is matrix addition, and homomorphic multiplication is
matrix multiplication.

<h3>Juggernaut: Efficient Crypto-Agnostic Byzantine Agreement<span class = "iconbox"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1601.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><img class = "pubicon" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/></a><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>
<p><a href="https://dcol.me/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Daniel Collins</a> (Texas A&amp;M) <br />
</p>
<p>It is well known that a trusted setup allows one to solve the Byzantine
agreement problem in the presence of \(t &lt; n/2\) corruptions, bypassing the
setup-free \(t &lt; n/3\) barrier. Alas, the overwhelming majority of protocols in
the literature have the caveat that their security crucially hinges on the
security of the cryptography and setup, to the point where if the cryptography
is broken, even a single corrupted party can violate the security of the
protocol. Thus these protocols provide higher corruption resilience (\(n/2\)
instead of \(n/3\)) for the price of increased assumptions. Is this trade-off
necessary?
</p>
<p>We further the study of crypto-agnostic Byzantine agreement among parties that
answers this question in the negative. Specifically, let \(t_s\) and \(t_i\) denote
two parameters such that (1) \(2t_i + t_s &lt; n\), and (2) \(t_i \le t_s &lt; n/2\).
Crypto-agnostic Byzantine agreement ensures agreement among honest parties if
(1) the adversary is computationally bounded and corrupts up to \(t_s\) parties,
or (2) the adversary is computationally unbounded and corrupts up to \(t_i\)
parties, and is moreover given all secrets of all parties established during
the setup. We propose a compiler that transforms any pair of
resilience-optimal Byzantine agreement protocols in the authenticated and
information-theoretic setting into one that is crypto-agnostic. Our compiler
has several attractive qualities, including using only \(O(kn^2)\) bits for
security parameter k over the two underlying Byzantine agreement protocols,
and preserving round and communication complexity in the authenticated
setting. In particular, our results improve the state-of-the-art in bit
complexity by at least two factors of n and provide either early stopping
(deterministic) or expected constant round complexity (randomized). We
therefore provide fallback security for authenticated Byzantine agreement for
free for \(t_i \le n/4\).

<h3>Registered ABE and Adaptively-Secure Broadcast Encryption from Succinct LWE<span class = "iconbox"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/044.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><img class = "pubicon" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/></a><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jchamps/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Jeff Champion</a> (UT Austin) <br />
</p>
<p>Registered attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a generalization of public-key
encryption that enables fine-grained access control to encrypted data (like
standard ABE), but <i>without</i> needing a central trusted authority. In a
key-policy registered ABE scheme, users choose their own public and private
keys and then register their public keys together with a decryption policy
with an (untrusted) key curator. The key curator aggregates all of the
individual public keys into a short master public key which serves as the
public key for an ABE scheme.
</p>
<p>Currently, we can build registered ABE for restricted policies (e.g., Boolean
formulas) from pairing-based assumptions and for general policies using
witness encryption or indistinguishability obfuscation. In this work, we
construct a key-policy registered ABE for general policies (specifically,
bounded-depth Boolean circuits) from the \(\ell\)-succinct learning with errors
(LWE) assumption in the random oracle model. The ciphertext size in our
registered ABE scheme is \(\mathsf{poly}(\lambda, d)\), where \(\lambda\) is a
security parameter and \(d\) is the depth of the circuit that computes the
policy circuit \(C\). Notably, this is independent of the length of the
attribute \(\mathbf{x}\) and is optimal up to the \(\mathsf{poly}(d)\) factor.
</p>
<p>Previously, the only lattice-based instantiation of registered ABE uses
witness encryption, which relies on private-coin evasive LWE, a stronger
assumption than \(\ell\)-succinct LWE. Moreover, the ciphertext size in previous
registered ABE schemes that support general policies (i.e., from obfuscation
or witness encryption) scales with \(\mathsf{poly}(\lambda, |\mathbf{x}|,
|C|)\). The ciphertext size in our scheme depends only on the depth of the
circuit (and not the length of the attribute or the size of the policy). This
enables new applications to identity-based distributed broadcast encryption.
</p>
<p>Our techniques are also useful for constructing <i>adaptively-secure</i>
(distributed) broadcast encryption, and we give the first scheme from the
\(\ell\)-succinct LWE assumption in the random oracle model. Previously, the
only lattice-based broadcast encryption scheme with adaptive security relied
on witness encryption in the random oracle model. All other lattice-based
broadcast encryption schemes only achieved selective security.

<h3>Rational Protocol Design: Overview and Recent Developments<span class = "iconbox"><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/pdf.svg" alt = "PDF"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/video.svg" alt = "Video"/><img class = "pubicon notpresent" src = "/img/icons/slides.svg" alt = "Slides"/></span></h3>
<p><a href="https://jagaray.com/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Juan Garay</a> (Texas A&amp;M) <br />
</p>
<p>Rational Protocol Design (RPD), introduced by Garay, Katz, Maurer, Tackmann
and Zikas [FOCS &rsquo;13] leverages the well-established real/ideal paradigm to
prove the security of cryptographic protocols against malicious attackers to
incorporate participants&rsquo; incentives to misbehave. In a nutshell, RPD casts a
protocol attack as a two-party game between a rational protocol designer and a
rational attacker. The attacker aims at breaking certain security properties,
from which he obtains his utility, by choosing an appropriate adversarial
strategy corresponding to a central adversary who gets to corrupt parties in a
standard cryptographic manner; symmetrically, the goal of the designer is to
come up with a protocol which (when executed by the parties who adhere to the
protocol) maximizes its own utility. Importantly, RPD allows for the
establishment of a partial order of protocols with respect to the property
under consideration (e.g., fairness). In this talk, after a brief introduction
of the RPD framework, we showcase it in a variety of applications, including
secure multi-party computation in the presence of a dishonest majority, fair
(reactive) 2-party computation, and the Bitcoin ledger, explaining why Bitcoin
continues to work even though majority coalitions are in fact possible.</p>
